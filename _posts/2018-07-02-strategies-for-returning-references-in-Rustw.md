A really neat explanation of some approaches to references in Rust.

I've been trying to get my head around the borrowing semantics of Rust. I'm really interested in the possibility of improving the state of memory usage in pure languages like Haskell with linear types and while I understand that some believe that the problem is better solved with regions based management I think Rust has a pretty nice system.

I hope to write a bit more on linear types, regions and Rust when I understand them better.

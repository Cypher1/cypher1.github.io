  **Blog**: a regularly updated website typically one run by an individual that is written in an informal style.

  Regularly? Probably not.
  Informal? Got that in the bag.

Hi, I'm Josh. I write software for a living and actually really enjoy it. Well, most of the time.

I keep finding myself wanting to write up some of the things I've learnt about and the mistakes I've made. So here we are. Hopefully someone can learn from it and possibly avoid the same issues that I had.

My first post will just cover some of the steps I took to set this site up as a bit of a walk through. If you're not wanting to build a site today feel free to look through it anyway.

It'll be easier if you already use a terminal regularly and are familiar with Git but I'll try to walk through everything without too many assumptions and linking to tutorials where possible.


# What are we using?

First I want to than David Darnes who make the [Alembic theme](https://alembic.darn.es) that is responsible for the majority of the styling for the site.

I plan to tweak it further to suite my needs but the theme is a lovely collection of useful templates and [CSS]() and is easy to install and use.

I'm using [Github Pages](), a very neat static site tool built by and integrated with Github . It takes a bunch of configuration files and pages written in [Markdown]() and turns them into a site that runs on `$USERNAME.github.io` for free.

## Steps


#### 1. Get a Github account or use one that you already have.

  - Sign up here (or you can use another git host and site host if you're familiar)
    - [ https://github.com/ ](https://github.com/)
  - Installing Git â€“ the easy way
    - [ https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03 ](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)
  - Setting up Git and Github on your Mac
    - [ http://burnedpixel.com/blog/setting-up-git-and-github-on-your-mac/ ](http://burnedpixel.com/blog/setting-up-git-and-github-on-your-mac/)
      
#### 2. Read a bit about Git if you're not familiar with it.
  - TODO links to git resources
#### 3. Create a new repository called `$USERNAME.github.io`.
  - TODO links to github
#### 4. Install git, ruby, bundler, jekyll, an editor etc.
#### 5. Create a new Jekyll site
#### 6. Set up 'upstream'
#### 7. What is \_config.yml
#### 8. Writing a first post
#### 9. Push

Done!

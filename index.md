In 2018 I started working full time. This gave me some time to think about how I might try to give back to the software development community that has given me so much.

I'm hoping to write about my experiences in the software industry, both as a 'script kiddy'/self-taught computer nerd and as a paid software engineer. I love learning more about the languages and tools that I use and being able to add something to them and I would love to be able to help someone else do the same.

If you have any questions or fixes you can message me at [the contact form](/contact).

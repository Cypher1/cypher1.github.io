In 2018 I started working full time as a software developer. This gave me some time to think about how I might try to give back to the software development community.

I'm hoping to write about my experiences in the software industry, problems I've faced with tools and solutions/hacks that I've discovered (or been gifted) along the way as well as a few interesting algorithms that I've learnt a bit about.

I have a particular interest in 'safe' languages, machine learning, and logic engines. Specifically I'm a big fan of Haskell and Rust, but have more experience in C++ and Python.

If you have any questions or fixes you can message me at [the contact form](/contact).
